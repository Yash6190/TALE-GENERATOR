The project is to generate a new story every time user runs the program.
When the code is executed, it generates a random story from the given stories in the code. If you want a new story you have to press 1 and it will provide a new story. You can generate the stories as many times you want. If you want to end the story, just press 0 and story will end.


 We first put the elements of the story in different lists. Then we used the random module to select random parts of the story collected in different lists. Then we used random.int command to initialise the story (as given in the code below). Then we print the story and the name of author.
